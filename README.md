### **ðŸ“‹ Description of the System**

This program simulates a game character system inspired by Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, featuring different character classes with unique abilities and stats. The system is implemented using object-oriented programming in Python, utilizing abstract base classes to define common character behaviors while allowing for specialization in each character class.

### **âš™ Key Components of the System**

1. **GameCharacter Abstract Base Class:** Defines the core attributes and methods that all characters share

2. **Specialized Character Classes:**

ðŸ›¡ **Tank:** High defense with shield capabilities

âš” **Fighter:** Balanced offense with rage and lifesteal mechanics

**Assassin:** High critical damage for burst attacks

**Mage:** Magic-based attacks with mana regeneration

Marksman: Long-range physical attacks with penetration

Support: Healing and buffing capabilities

Interactive Menu: Allows users to view character stats or simulate a battle sequence

How to Run the Program
Prerequisites:

Python 3.x installed on your system

Basic understanding of Python (to modify or extend the code if needed)

Running the Program:

Save the code to a file with .py extension (e.g., game_characters.py)

Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the file

Run the program using the command: python game_characters.py

Program Options:

Option 1: Showcase Characters - Displays detailed stats for all character classes

Option 2: Simulate Battle - Runs a sequence of character actions simulating a battle

Option 3: Exit - Terminates the program

### **ðŸ”” Acknowledgement**
This program was created as an educational demonstration of object-oriented programming concepts in Python, particularly:
ðŸ’» **Abstract base classes**
ðŸ’» **Inheritance**
ðŸ’» **Polymorphism**
ðŸ’» **Encapsulation**

The character classes and mechanics are inspired by **Mobile Legends: Bang Bang**, though simplified for demonstration purposes. This implementation serves as a foundation that could be expanded into a more comprehensive game system with additional features like actual combat calculations, character interactions, and more sophisticated battle simulations.

Special thanks to the Python community for providing excellent documentation and resources that make learning object-oriented programming accessible.
