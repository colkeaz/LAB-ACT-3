### **📋 Description of the System**

This program simulates a game character system inspired by Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, featuring different character classes with unique abilities and stats. The system is implemented using object-oriented programming in Python, utilizing abstract base classes to define common character behaviors while allowing for specialization in each character class.

---
### **⚙ Key Components of the System**

1. **GameCharacter Abstract Base Class:** Defines the core attributes and methods that all characters share

2. **Specialized Character Classes:**

🛡️ **Tank:** High defense with shield capabilities

⚔️ **Fighter:** Balanced offense with rage and lifesteal mechanics

🗡️ **Assassin:** High critical damage for burst attacks

🔮 **Mage:** Magic-based attacks with mana regeneration

🏹 **Marksman:** Long-range physical attacks with penetration

🧿 **Support:** Healing and buffing capabilities


3.  **Interactive Menu:** Allows users to view character stats or simulate a battle sequence

---
### **How to Run the Program**

**Program Options:**

⚙ Option 1: Showcase Characters - Displays detailed stats for all character classes

⚙ Option 2: Simulate Battle - Runs a sequence of character actions simulating a battle

⚙ Option 3: Exit - Terminates the program

### **🔔 Acknowledgement**

This program was created as an educational demonstration of object-oriented programming concepts in Python, particularly:

💻 **Abstract base classes**

💻 **Inheritance**

💻 **Polymorphism**

💻 **Encapsulation**

The character classes and mechanics are inspired by **Mobile Legends: Bang Bang**, though simplified for demonstration purposes. This implementation serves as a foundation that could be expanded into a more comprehensive game system with additional features like actual combat calculations, character interactions, and more sophisticated battle simulations.

Special thanks to our instructor, **Ma'am Fatima Marie Agdon** for her dedication on teaching this programming language. Of course, to the Python community for providing excellent documentation and resources that make learning object-oriented programming accessible.
